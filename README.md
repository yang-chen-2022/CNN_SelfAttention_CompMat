# fullfieldDamage-CNNSA
Apply a Convolutional Neural Network with self-attention (CNNSA) to predicting full field damage in composites

  - Implementation based on PyTorch
  - Required packages: 
    - _imgaug_ for data augmentation
    - _vtk_ for importing image data
  - Pre-trained models provided
  - Example data provided for users to check the performance of the pre-trained model themselves
